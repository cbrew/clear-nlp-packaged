After just a week on the market, the iPhone 5 has owners writing up a laundry list of faults with the new device.
Soon after the iPhone 5 went on sale last Friday, users started filling up discussion forums and social networks 
with reports of scratches and nicks on their brand-new phones. People say they've noticed the defects around the 
aluminum band surrounding the phone, with the issue more visible on the black version of the new iPhone. Those 
complaints don't appear to bother Apple. "Any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use, exposing its natural 
silver color," Apple Senior Marketing VP Phil Schiller said in an e-mail, according to 9to5Mac, "That is normal."
Apple seems much more taken aback by the flap over its iOS 6 Maps app -- so much so that CEO Tim Cook on Friday 
took the startling step, for Apple, of issuing a major mea culpa for falling short of delivering the best possible 
experience. "We are extremely sorry," Cook wrote, "for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are 
doing everything we can to make Maps better."
